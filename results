  <p>  There is no way you'd like it in Austin.  The heat, the traffic, and the hangers-on would violate your more refined sensibilities.  What the hell were you thinking, anyway?  Austin is it Texas- it can only do so much.</p>

<p><span>  You should consider somewhere else.</p></span>
  <p>  You can do better than this place.  Maybe you need a bigger city; maybe you need a smaller city.  But Austin, with it's middle-sized-city problems and realities, probably isn't a good fit for you.</p>

<p><span>  You would like it here... more or less.</p></span>
  <p>  Maybe it's the tacos, or the music, or the young people... but something about Austin would probably turn you on.  (Sigh...) you should probably move here.  Thanks for being part of the traffic problem.</p>

  <p>  You're practically already an Austinite.  You like torchy's.  You have hipster hair.  You believe in art.  Good for you! Your brothers and sisters are waiting for you... what's taken you so long?  Welcome home!</p>
